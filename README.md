This project focuses on achieving real-time vehicle detection dynamically, enabling instant recognition of vehicles in motion. Vehicle detection plays a critical role in ensuring the safety of autonomous cars by helping them avoid accidents and maintain safe distances from other vehicles on the road. Through this project, I've gained valuable experience in deploying code dynamically, a crucial skill for creating real-time projects that can adapt and update as needed.
